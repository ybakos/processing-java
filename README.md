# Processing in Pure Java
## No PDEs, no IDEs, no drama.

Love [Processing](http://processing.org) but want to write more idiomatic Java programs? Hate Eclipse? Like [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com)?

This is a boilerplate Java project for writing Processing programs in pure Java. A simple [ant](http://ant.apache.org) buildfile is included.

## How to Run
`ant`
That is all. See [build.xml](build.xml) for other simple tasks.

You should rename every occurance of `RenameMe` found in the codebase and buildfile. This is a temporary placeholder for what will eventually be managed by a simple project generator.
